- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @X448NAX
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile app development, specifically Dart/Flutter, as well as Python and JS.
- ðŸ”’ Iâ€™m interested in privacy focused Python projects and am working on a couple of my own to release shortly.
- ðŸ‘€ I tend to use [my gists](https://gist.github.com/X448NAX) as a mini blog for documenting useful stuff for me to look back at later and hopefully helps others too.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/hkp/A1E987C6A8AA5EA031411AAF70FEEBB21535B6FA) or [Keybase.](https://keybase.io/thexanman)
